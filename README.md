# GameINIGenerator
Generates Game.INI files for Dolphin

To use this tool, visit its webpage [here](https://sixdigitcode.github.io/GameINIGenerator/).

This tool makes it easy to create game-specific settings (such as render resolution or effects) for the Dolphin emulator. All settings that are inactive won't be included and will use Dolphin's main settings, so be sure to activate the settings you want to use. Once you're done choosing your settings, click on "Generate INI" and copy the output in the text box. In Dolphin, right-click on a game and choose Properties. Under "Game Config", choose "Editor". Paste the generated INI settings in the "User Config" text box.
